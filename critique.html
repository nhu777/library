                <p class="centered-body">ONE OF MY GOALS FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS HAS BEEN TO READ MORE OFTEN, AND FROM THIS TED TALK, I LEARNED HOW MUCH THAT CAN MATTER TO MYSELF AND TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. FICTION IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FORMS OF READING, AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE THEORY OF MIND, WHICH IS THE ABILIITY TO ATTRIBUTE MENTAL STATES TO OURSELVES AND OTHERS. PEOPLE WHO DON’T HAVE THIS ABILITY ARE HANDICAPPED IN THEIR SOCIAL LIVES AND ARE LIMITED WITH SMALL IMAGINATIONS. THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT READING FICTION ESPECIALLY IS THAT YOU’RE NOT JUST LEARNING ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON IN A PERSON’S HEAD, BUT YOU’RE ALSO EXPERIENCING IT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOURSELF. ADDITIONALLY, READING FORCES YOU TO USE PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT AREN’T NATURALLY EXERCISED, AND READING FICTION IS THE BEST WORKOUT YOUR BRAIN CAN GET. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT READERS BECOME AT LEAST TEMPORARILY MORE SENSITIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE’S FEELINGS, AND THE MORE YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO SYMPATHIZE AND EMPATHIZE THROUGH BOOKS, THE MORE PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF A PERSON YOU ARE.</p>
