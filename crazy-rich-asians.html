            <h1>	
                **spoiler alert** I haven't read a book as lighthearted as this one in a while, so it was a nice reprieve in my day whenever I reached for this! It's a total page-turner and you can't help but get excited by the enamor of the extreme wealth the characters are exposed to. However, I admittingly enjoyed the movie adaptation of Crazy Rich Asians over the book because of the character development that was more apparent in the film. I wish Rachel made a stronger lasting impression on me or on any of the characters in the story, but she seemed mostly meek and people-pleasing when she interacted with Nick's family. There's also no portrayal of her supposed-intelligence as an economics professor, so I found that I didn't respect her as much as I did in the movie. A more shining side-storyline would have to be that of Astrid Leong, though she also fails to give any rebuttal to her weak-minded husband when he decides to leave her. And lastly, I wish Fiona Tung had more of an appearance in the book because she seems to be the only female character who is capable of speaking up for herself.
