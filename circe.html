            <h1>	
                Madeline Miller seems to write in such a timeless way that is simultaneously modern and representative of a recreation of older text. I've enjoyed Circe and Son of Achilles even more because of her elegant use of words, and after reading certain lines, I just have to pause for a second and reread how beautifully she is able to craft a sentence. As for the character and storyline development, I really enjoyed how Circe grew throughout this book. I admittingly tend to have a problem with female leads in novels because of how they are portrayed as outlandishly strong-headed and overly brave and ruthless. For Circe, I had to read through her weak stages to see her finally develop into a woman of character and passion. It also gave me a glimpse into motherhood, which I thought Madeline Miller portrayed beautifully. And lastly, I love how Miller really put in perspective the meaningfulness of being alive and being human. This was a really enthralling read for me (but admittingly, for me, not as enticing as her other work -- Song of Achillies).
