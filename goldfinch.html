            <h1>	
                This was a hard book for me to get through because I sometimes failed to see the overarching mystery that the summary alludes to. Though the untimely death of Theodore's mother seems totally random and unexplained, the cause of it seems to be ignored more than I anticipated it to be. I also felt a certain lull through certain scenes involving Boris when he's an adult because the book takes a turn into a mob/gangster-like sort of scenario that is completely out of the blue and a little stereotypical for a Russian (or was he Ukranian?) character. Despite these lags in the plot, however, I really did admire some of the emotions Tart was able to capture of the bleakness of human life that underlies Theodore's entire being. There seems to be so little for him to live for, that at times, I feel like I almost wanted him to die if only to relieve the endless amount of pain he's had to endure since his mother's death. Right when you think Theodore hits rock bottom, he actually just goes even deeper into despair. This is not an emotionally light read, but it does have a sense of optimism towards the end that unexpectedly portrays the beauty of life in a manner that is not usually common for advocating why life is worth living.

                "Kids shouting and skidding in the playground with no idea what future Hells awaited them: boring jobs and ruinous mortgages and bad marriages and hair loss and hip replacements and lonely cups of coffee in an empty house and a colostomy bag at the hospital. Most poeple seemed satisfied with the thin decorative glaze and the artful stage lighting that, sometimes, made the bedrock atrocity of the human predicament look somewhat more mysterious or less abhorrent. People gambled and golfed and planted gardens and traded stocks and had sex and bought new cars and practiced yoga and worked and prayed and redecorated their homes and got worked up over the news and fussed over their children and gossipped about their neighbors and pored over restaurant reviews and founded charitable organizations and supported political candidates and attended the U.S. Open and dined and travelled and distracted themselves with all kinds of gadgets and devices, flooding themselves incessently with information and texts and communication and entertainment from every direction to try to make themselves forget it: where we were, what we were. But in a strong light there was no good spin you could put on it. It was rotten top to bottom. Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned peaches at the nursing home. It was better to have never been born -- never to have wanted anything, never to have hoped for anything."
