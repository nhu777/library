            <h1>	
                This book was out-of-this-world heartwarming as it follows the intense struggles of four generations of a family line in a totally immersive and candid way. I loved how the storyline is so deep-rooted in the history of Korea, Japan, and America, as I've never read a historical fiction book before. It's almost disappointing to know that the characters are all fictional because I grew to love so many of them. Min Jin Lee does a phenomenal job with characterizing each family member in 'Pachinko'; and each individual's undying devotion to their family and friendships is insanely respectable. I can go on about my adoration for each of the characters -- Noa's passion for school and honor, Mozasu's generosity, Kyunghee's compassion, Isak's gentleness, Kim Chango's faithfulness, Totoyama's kindness...You really can't help but root for each person's success in life, and I'm sad to have finished following this crazy 1900 Korean journey.

                      “There was consolation: The people you loved, they were always there with you, she had learned. Sometimes, she could be in front of a train kiosk or the window of a bookstore, and she could feel Noa's small hand when he was a boy, and she would close her eyes and think of his sweet grassy smell and remember that he had always tried his best. At those moments, it was good to be alone to hold on to him."

                      “Sunja-ya, a woman’s life is endless work and suffering. There is suffering and then more suffering. It’s better to expect it, you know. You’re becoming a woman now, so you should be told this. For a woman, the man you marry will determine the quality of your life completely. A good man is a decent life, and a bad man is a cursed life—but no matter what, always expect suffering, and just keep working hard. No one will take care of a poor woman—just ourselves."
