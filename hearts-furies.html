            <h1>	
                This book was one of my top 10 reads of all time because it's one of the only novels that's ever made me simultaneously laugh out loud and want to cry. There is so much intoxicating banter that is both engaging and telling of the characters and their colorful personalities. Cyril Avery was an amazing protagonist, and although he made many mistakes in his lifetime, I would say that I was on his side each time. The amount of empathy I had for him was beyond measure, and finishing the book was like losing a long-loved family member (I feel like I say this for a lot of books, but I had a truly special relationship with Cyril). I wish I could continue rooting for Cyril forever, especially because of his sarcastic wit and humor, which was a nice contrast to the dark and harrowing themes throughout the novel. I also really enjoyed learning about the conservative and unforgiving nature of 1940s Ireland and how history has not made it easy for some people to be happy. Following probably 100 years of life just made me more attached to every character I encountered, so despite this being an almost-600-page-monster of a read, I breezed through it and wished for it to never end.

                      “There was consolation: The people you loved, they were always there with you, she had learned. Sometimes, she could be in front of a train kiosk or the window of a bookstore, and she could feel Noa's small hand when he was a boy, and she would close her eyes and think of his sweet grassy smell and remember that he had always tried his best. At those moments, it was good to be alone to hold on to him."

                “Cyril, you remember Peter and Ruth, don't you?' she said.
             <p class="quote">
                'Of course' I replied. 'Happy Christmas. Nice to see you both again.'
             </p>
             <p class="quote">
                 'Happy Christmas to you,' said Peter, an enormous man bursting out of an extra-large shirt. 'And may the blessings of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior be with you on this momentous day.'

                'Fair enough,' I said 'Hello, Ruth.”
