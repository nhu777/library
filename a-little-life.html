            <h1>	
                I found this book during a time when I really wanted to move to New York and, quite appropriately, I found it through an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-subversive-brilliance-of-a-little-life">article</a> in The New Yorker. I was sold just hearing the mentionings of four friends flocking to the city, a place 'populated by the ambitious,' and the novel really does succeed in capturing those friendships as well as romanticizing the best parts about New York. It's a book that I looked forward to reading everyday and knew would be hard to put down each time because of its gripping, graphic, devastating, and beautiful content. The characters in A Little Life are unparalleled to any other book I've read. I wish I could give Andy and Jude and Willem and Harold each a Nobel Peace Prize or a real life hug because they are a few of the people in the novel that affected me the most and who still haven't really left my consciousness, as most other book characters do. I've also never felt so much emotion as I did reading a few of the scenes, and flipping each page was like a total shot to the heart because I knew that the worst was going to happen. As a reader, it's hard to sit and watch it unfold, but it's a really gratifying experience to be able to feel so much from a book. After finishing A Little Life, I knew I would struggle to find anything emotionally equivalent to it, as it really contains some of the most heartfelt and painful scenes I've encountered through reading. I also love how Yanagihara talks about friendships, as the compassion and gratitude Jude possesses for his loved ones is a lot like how I feel about my special people as well. I can't express how much I adored this book, so it'll definitely have to be categorized as my favorite read ever!

It was two people who remained together, day after day, bound not by sex or physical attraction or money or children or property, but only by the shared agreement to keep going, the mutual dedication to a union that could never be codified."
