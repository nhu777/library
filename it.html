            <h1>	
                As many readers may claim, this was the longest book I've ever read! It was rewarding to finish an 1,153 page novel, but I think the length of it took away from the beauty of the story, only because I began to lose sight of the overarching purpose of the whole journey. This book left me feeling simultaneously fulfilled and unsatisfied, but one thing that Stephen King succeeds in is actually making every page matter. As always, he weaves an amazing story with the loveliest, most well-flowing sentences, and to this day - over one year later - I am admittingly still scared of storm drains. He captures fear in such a palpable way, but makes each experience feel unique and captivating (and trust me, this book has a lot of different scares and stories). The reason I loved 'It' more than its scare factor, however, was the character of stuttering Bill. Just like the group of friends that surrounds him throughout the novel, I grew to sincerely love Bill. He's a character that you will wholeheartedly look up to and cheer-on, and he is the voice of wisdom, kindness, and intelligence for both readers in the real world and characters in the book. This wasn't my favorite Stephen King novel, but it is defintiely one worthy of respect.

                â€œCalling it a simple schoolgirl crush was like saying a Rolls-Royce was a vehicle with four wheels, something like a hay-wagon. She did not giggle wildly and blush when she saw him, nor did she chalk his name on trees or write it on the walls of the Kissing Bridge. She simply lived with his face in her heart all the time, a kind of sweet, hurtful ache. She would have died for him.."
